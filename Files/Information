INFORMATION AND CHECKLIST:

c1:
	- Polyalphabetic cipher
	- Period looking to be 7-9
	- Testing period 7
	- Testing the word 'helpful' as the key (does not work).

c2:
	- Transposition cipher
	- Josh has tested Columnar
	- Railway transposition does not seem applicable

c3:
	- Polyalphabetic cipher
	- Period looking to be 7-9 (likely 8)

c4: (f(p) = (ap + b) mod 26

	- Monoalphabetic cipher
	- Testing two greatest to be e (144, 143) as a caesar shift (moving forward. Does not work)
	- Testing two greatest to be e except now backwards (also does not work)
	- Tried an affine cipher with a being 9. p was 11 and b was 9. (did not work)
	
	
TO-DO:
	- Find new keyword for c1. (Thinking its a vigenere
	- Test for other types of polyalphabetic ciphers.
